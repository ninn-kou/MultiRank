Please be advised that at the time of rewriting this code, I had a limited understanding of Python and its corresponding libraries and modules. As such, it is possible that there may be errors present within the code. I would like to clarify that my intent in revising this code was solely to replicate the initial results for my own scientific research endeavors. It should be noted that I am unable to provide any assurances regarding the accuracy of the code or algorithm utilized.
